# notion-bookshelf

Script for migrating my [Notion](https://www.notion.so) book-tracking setup to a new database schema and automate some of the metadata collection and data entry, using of the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/), [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview), and [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api).
